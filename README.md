# Abandoned. Planning on recreating this as a NW.js application

## challonger ; A tournament bracket simulator, but not that kind tournament.


Planned features (sorted by priority):
- Gamepad support
	- Admin gampad (only 1 gamepad connected) vs voter mode (each gamepad gets one vote)
- Choose search API
	- Currently only ANILIST api, allow user to select between: ANILIST, GOOGLE, or IMDB (post-release update)
	- Google only allows 100 search requests-- tred wisely.
- Multi threaded
- Theme selection (incorperate CSS files)
- Implement a webview to show a bracket style overview of the tournament;;;or build one using a gui
